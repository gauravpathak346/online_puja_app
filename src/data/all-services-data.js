      "Kumbha Vivaha: Kumbha Vivaha is a revered practice that aids females in alleviating the effects of Manglik dosha present in their horoscopes. Mangal Graha, often regarded as the Malefic Planet or Papi Graha, has a significant influence on an individual's marriage prospects. The positioning of Mangal in certain houses can lead to the formation of Mangalik dosha. The dosha is considered present when Mangal or Kuja Graha occupies the 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, or 12th house of the horoscope, and influences the 7th house of the Kundali.",
      "The highest degree of Manglik dosha is observed when Mars sits in both the 1st and 7th houses. The 7th house holds immense importance as it signifies marriage and the life partner or spouse. According to Vedic astrology, Mars in the seventh house is deemed inauspicious for marriage and married life.",
      "If a Manglik boy/girl is wedded to a Non-Manglik partner, several cases have shown instances of severe accidents or unfortunate events, leading to the demise or permanent disability of the Non-Manglik spouse. Additionally, the placement of Sun, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu in the aforementioned houses can also contribute to the formation of partial Manglik Dosh.",

Each Nakshatra is further divided into four Padas, intricate divisions that shape an individual's destiny.",
